As of November 13th, 2023, site Visitors are welcomed by a drone-footage video of the city of Seattle on the homepage, along with information about the city and a brief quiz to help find restaurants or activities nearby.

Using the navigation bar across the top, they can view information about the various districts of Seattle, or browse things to do, places to stay and restaurants within the city.

## Coming Soon

The Visit Seattle team is always striving to improve, so here are a few future plans we're working towards:
- Interactive map integration, so users can view all lodgings, activities, and restaurants in a given area by selecting the district
- Continued styling tweaks and improved responsive design
- Filtering within the list pages for restaurants, activities, and lodging
- Ability to view details of generated restaurants and activities directly from the quiz on the homepage
- User login and the ability to save favorites
- Admin login to access CUD operations
- CUD operations for lodgings and restaurants, in addition to activities
