This park offers a mostly level loop trail spanning 2.8 miles, taking you through charming forests and meadows. Don't forget to bring a picnic to savor by the beach, where you can take in stunning vistas of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.

The trail is an eight-mile round trip, ascending 3,100 feet, and rewards hikers with breathtaking views from the summit. If you're looking for something more beginner-friendly, nearby Rattlesnake Ledge offers a relatively easy two-mile trail with stunning perspectives and typically sees a constant flow of hikers. On your way back to Seattle, take a break at the Salish Lodge (*6501 Railroad Ave SE), where you can savor a meal while gazing at the majestic Snoqualmie Falls, which also features a family-friendly hiking trail.",
